Welcome to the NextJS base template bootstrapped using the `create-next-app`. This template supports TypeScript, but you can use normal JavaScript as well.

## Getting Started

Hit the run button to start the development server.


## Productionizing your Next App

To make your next App run smoothly in production make sure to [turn this repl to an always-on repl.](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/enabling-always-on)

You can also produce a production build by running `npm run build` and [changing the run command](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/configuring-repl#run) to `npm run start`.
